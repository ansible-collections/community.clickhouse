[![Plugins CI](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.clickhouse/workflows/Plugins%20CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.clickhouse/actions?query=workflow%3A"Plugins+CI") [![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ansible-collections/community.clickhouse)](https://codecov.io/gh/ansible-collections/community.clickhouse)

## Our mission

At the `community.clickhouse` Ansible collection project,
our mission is to produce and maintain simple, flexible,
and powerful open-source software tailored to automating ClickHouse-related tasks.

We welcome members from all skill levels to participate actively in our open, inclusive, and vibrant community.
Whether you are an expert or just beginning your journey with Ansible and ClickHouse,
you are encouraged to contribute, share insights, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts.

We strive to make managing ClickHouse deployments as effortless and efficient as possible with automation,
enabling users to focus on their core objectives.

## External requirements

- [clickhouse-driver](https://clickhouse-driver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python connector installed on a target machine.

## Using this collection

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the ClickHouse collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.clickhouse
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.clickhouse
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically if you upgrade the Ansible package.
To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.clickhouse --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.clickhouse:==0.1.0
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

### Usage example

```yaml
- name: Create database
  community.clickhouse.clickhouse_db:
    name: test_db
    engine: Memory
    state: present
    comment: Test DB

- name: Get server information
  register: result
  community.clickhouse.clickhouse_info:

- name: Print server information
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: result

# Note: it runs SELECT version() just for the sake of example.
# You can get it with the task above much more conveniently.
- name: Query DB using non-default user & DB to connect to
  register: result
  community.clickhouse.clickhouse_client:
    execute: SELECT version()
    login_host: localhost
    login_user: alice
    login_db: foo
    login_password: my_password

- name: Print returned server version
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: result.result
```
